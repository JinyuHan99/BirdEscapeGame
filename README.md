BirdEscapeGame
This is a small game developed based on a Unity engine tutorial from YouTube, utilizing Unity version 2022.3.10f1c1. The Unity engine tutorial available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM

In addition to the features mentioned in the tutorial, my code has introduced:

an initial start screen where players can either start, enter the setting menu, or exit the game. On the start screen, the bird hops on the pipes automatically, and player control over the bird's jumps begins only after clicking 'Start'.
a settings menu to control the volume of BGM and sound effects
high score tracking and updates
The 'assets' and 'game resource' folders contain relevant code and media resources, respectively. The built files can be found in the 'my game' folder, where 'My project.exe' can be directly executed to run the game.
